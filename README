This is a rough basic version of a drag and drop html / javscript EPG 
client for the a Universal Control API-enabled instance of MythTV: 
https://github.com/bbcrd/UCMythTV/wiki

==Warning==

This is a first pass only! Lots of things are wrong and lots of things 
don't work properly.

==Before you start==

* make sure mythtv backend is running (if you use the UC mythtv version 
it should automatically run on starting up the machine)

ps ax | grep myth

* make sure mythtvfrontend is running

/usr/bin/mythfrontend

* make sure UC server is running

/opt/uc/ucserver &


==Installation==

This assumes you have apache2 webserver up and running (the UC version 
of MythTV has this).

cd /var/www/
mkdir dd #or anything except 'uc'
cd dd
unzip dd_uc.zip
sudo cat htaccess_sample >> ../.htaccess

then go to

http://machine_ip/dd/

on that machine or another on the local network.

and you should see a 'TV' and a series of boxes with information about 
what's on on each channel. Drag a programme box to the TV to play it.

==Libraries==

It's all down to these libraries:

* jquery drag and drop ui
http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/
http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/

* touch jquery addon  
http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-for-ipad-and-iphone/
